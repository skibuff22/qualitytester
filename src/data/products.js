    description: `Extremely accurate measurements (0.5% of full scale). Open frame design allows you to see and place your hands as needed. Long-lasting ACME lead screw requires less force to operate, and will not fail with repeated use. Extended travel, over 4” with our fixture to completely extract even the longest fasteners. Reach up to 1-7/8” below the top surface for recessed screws. Strong frame, yet smaller and lighter than other portable pull testers. Built with tight tolerances and low friction polymer bearings to prevent misalignment and rattling. Works with all Force-Test and most Com-Ten fixtures. Durable gauge guard to help prevent expensive repair bills. One year warranty.
